### RPG Web Game in solo

its a game in memory of a good and great game from my childhood time, I want to create a game who got some easter eggs but is still independent.

It takes place in **Weyard** an enormous world filled with magic and creatures.

>In this game Reiner(the player) want to live a great life of adventure with misadventures and joys, unfortunately Reiner and his friend will be forced to, an evil organization plan to run the world by reaslising Djinns in Weyard, they will try to asserve Djinns so they can use their power to rule the world of Weyard....You and your friend will do all you can to save the world from great destruction....grow stronger with the help of Djinns, learn new Psynergy spell, make friends....and **GO** save the world.

## Rules

* The player move with ZQSD and interact with space and E
* The player can interract with PNJs and objects 
* The player sometimes enter in combat when walking outside citys and can choose an action like attack, magic, run.  
* While the player travel he will encounter ennemies and got different quest who will lead him to save the world

## CODE & API 

This game is developed in **JavaScript** using **Phaser**

## DATAS

You can explore villages and a whole world 

So basically, something like this for the villages :

And like this for the world map : ![alt text](http://www.vgmaps.com/Atlas/GBA/GoldenSun-World.png)

Of course I don't have the time and experience to do something this big, but I will do my best

You will earn Djinns as you explore the world, Djinns are elemental monsters that empower the player and can be used against enemies.

For the Djinns I will try to find something from the original references, something like this :
