### RPG Web Game in solo

its a game in memory of a good and great game from my childhood time, I want to create a game who got some easter eggs but is still independent.

In this game Reiner(the player) want to live a great life of adventure with misadventure and joy, you will grow stronger and stronger with your childhood friends and with the power of Psynergy, you will make friends while you travel this fantastic world.

You will earn Djinns as you explore the world, Djinns are elemental monsters that empower the player and can be used against enemies.

## Rules

* The player can interract with PNJs and objects

* While the player travel he will encounter ennemies and got different quest who will lead him to save the world

## CODE & API

Of course I don't have the time and experience to do something this big, but I will do my best
